# 4 Cache

## Basic

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220414195448.png)

### Principle of Locality

- Temporal Locality (locality in time)

    If a memory location is referenced then it will tend to be referenced again soon

- Spatial Locality (locality in space)

    If a memory location is referenced, the locations with nearby addresses will tend to be referenced soon

### Caching Terminology

- **Cache hit**

    Cache holds a valid copy of the block, so return the desired data

- **Cache miss**

    Cache does not have desired block, so fetch from memory and put in empty (invalid) slot

Average Memory Access Time(AMAT) = (1−Miss Rate)× Hit Time + Miss Rate × (Hit Time + Miss Penalty) = Hit time + Miss rate × 
Miss penalty

CPI = CPI + $\text{CPI}_{I\$}$ + $\text{CPI}_{D\$}$

### Cache block replacement policy

- Random Replacement

- Least Recently Used (LRU)

    Replace block we used(hit & miss) least recently first in the hopes we will use it again later than all other blocks

- FIFO

    Replace block we miss least recently

### Caching Read & Write

we assume the use of separate instruction and data
caches (Icache and Dcache)
- Read from both
- Write only to Dcache (assume no self-modifying code)

Write Hits

- **Write-Through** Policy: Always write data to cache and to memory (through cache)
- **Write-Back** Policy: Write data only to cache, then update memory when block is replaced
    - clean block: no extra traffic
    - dirty block: extra “writeback” of block

```armasm
# If 512 and 1024 map to the same cache block:
# the cache line becomes dirty but memory is not updated yet.
SW R3,512(R0)
# cache miss,evict block of 512, must write back. Instead of waiting for memory to finish writing, the dirty block is placed into the write-back buffer so the cache can continue.
LW R1,1024(R0)  
# if the write-back buffer hasn't finished writing the dirty block to memory, load will get old data value from memory
LW R2,512(R0)
```

Write Miss

- **Write Allocate** policy: when we bring the block into the cache after a write miss
    - Write allocate almost always paired with write-back(Data is likely to be used again)

- **No Write Allocate** policy: only change main memory after a write miss
    - No write allocate typically paired with write-through(Data is not likely to be used again)

## Processor Address Fields

a cache of fixed size (C), Memory is (A) byte-addressed

- Offset: denotes block size: (# = K) Bytes
- Index:  array of block “frames”

    (# = $log_2{(C/K/N)}$)

    - Fully associative (1 set): 0 Index bits!
    - Direct-mapped (N = 1): max Index bits
    - N-way set-associative: somewhere in-between
    
- Tag: Each frame can hold one of $2^T$ blocks (T = A – I – O)

Lookup algorithm
- Read frame indicated by index bits
- "Hit" if tag matches and valid bit is set
- Otherwise, a "miss". Get data from next level


<table>
<tr><th>type</th><th colspan="3">Fields</th></tr>
<tr><td>Fully Associative</td><td colspan ="2">Tag</td><td>Offset</td></tr>
<tr><td>Direct-mapped</td><td>Tag</td><td>Index</td><td>Offset</td></tr>
<tr><td>N-way set-associative</td><td>Tag</td><td>Index</td><td>Offset</td></tr>
</table>

### Fully Associative Cache

- Total bits

    In a slot:

    - Tag field of address as identifier (Tag bits)
    - Valid bit (1 bit): Whether cache slot was filled in
    - Dirty bit (1 bit if write-back)
    - Any necessary replacement management bits (“LRU bits”)

    Total bits in cache = # of frames $\times$ bits per frame = $(C/K) \times (8 \times 2^{O} + Tag + 1 + 1 + ?)$ bits

- To check a fully associative cache

    1. Look at ALL cache slots in sequence
    2. If Valid bit is 0, then ignore
    3. If Valid bit is 1 and Tag matches, then return that data

- Example

    Offset – 2 bits, Tag – 4 bits

### Direct-Mapped

- Total bits

    Total bits in cache = $(C/K) \times (8 \times 2^{O} + Tag + 1 + 1 + ?)$ bits

- Example

    ![20220414211441](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220414211441.png)

    ![20220414212112](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220414212112.png)

### N-way set-associative

Divide Cache into sets, each of which consists of N slots

- Memory block maps to a set determined by Index field and is placed in any of the N slots of that set
- Replacement policy applies to every set

Total bits = $2^I \times N \times (8 \times 2^{O} + Tag + 1 + 1 + ?)$ bits

Example

Compulsory Miss: 0(first),4,8,20,16

Capacity Miss: 0(second) (after its last access we have unique block accesses to 0001,0010,0101,0100, but we only have space for 4−1=3 more unique accesses)

## Cache Questions

### AMAT

3 parameters: Hit time, miss rate, miss penalty

- Hit Time
    - Cache size decreases → hit time decreases
    - associativity increases → hit time increases
- Miss Rate
    - Larger blocks, larger caches, more associativity can hold more data → miss rate decreases
    - Compiler optimizations
- Miss penalty
    - Multilevel caches
    - Smaller block size → lower MP

3Cs(Sources of Cache Misses):

- **Compulsory**: First access to block impossible to avoid
    - Increase block size (increases MP; too large blocks could increase MR because the number of blocks that can be held in the same size cache is smaller)
- **Capacity**: Cache cannot contain all blocks accessed by the program
    - Increase cache size (may increase HT)
- **Conflict**: Multiple memory locations mapped to the same cache location
    - Increase associativity (to fully associative) (may increase HT)
    - Increase block size(a set can hold more data)

Capacity or Conflict Miss

after the last access unique block accesses vs Fully Associative Space -1 

### Multilevel Caches

![20220414213239](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220505164243.png)

Design Considerations

- L1 cache focuses on *low hit time* (fast access)
    - e.g. smaller cache
- L2 L3 focus on low *miss rate*
    - e.g. larger cache with larger block sizes

Local vs. Global Miss Rates

- Local miss rate: Fraction of references to one level of a cache that miss
    - e.g.  L2 local MR = L2 misses/L1 misses
- Global miss rate: Fraction of all references that miss in all levels of a multilevel cache
    - Global MR is the product of all local MRs

### Compiler Optimization

#### Loop Interchange

By switching the order in which loops execute, misses can be reduced due to improvements in spatial locality. 

```cpp
/* Before */
for (k = 0; k < 100; k = k+1)
	for (j = 0; j < 100; j = j+1)
		for (i = 0; i < 5000; i = i+1)
			x[i][j] = 2 * x[i][j];
/* After */
for (k = 0; k < 100; k = k+1)
	for (i = 0; i < 5000; i = i+1)
		for (j = 0; j < 100; j = j+1)
			x[i][j] = 2 * x[i][j];
```

#### Matrix Multiply

Before capacity miss: $((N+N)N+N)\times N= 2N^3 + N^2$

After capacity miss: $(BN+BN)+B^2)\times(N/B)^2=2N^3/B + N^2$


```cpp
/* Before */
for (i = 0; i < N; i = i+1)
	for (j = 0; j < N; j = j+1){
        r = 0;
        for (k = 0; k < N; k = k+1)
            r = r + y[i][k]*z[k][j];
        x[i][j] = r;
	};
/* After */
for (jj = 0; jj < N; jj = jj+B)
for (kk = 0; kk < N; kk = kk+B)
for (i = 0; i < N; i = i+1)
	for (j = jj; j < min(jj+B-1,N); j = j+1){
        r = 0;
        for (k = kk; k < min(kk+B-1,N); k = k+1)
            r = r + y[i][k]*z[k][j];
        x[i][j] = x[i][j] + r;
	};

```

- Y benefits from spatial locality
- Z benefits from temporal locality

#### Prefetching

cache size: 8kB, block size: 16 Bytes, data cache strategy: direct-mapped, write-back, write-allocate

The elements of a and b are 8 bytes long(double precision floating-point arrays)

```cpp
//a[3][100] b[101][3]
for( i=0; i <3; i = i +1) 
    for( j=0; j<100; j=j+1)
        a[i][j] = b[j][0] * b[j+1][0];
//A[i][j]:Among 3*100,the even value of j will miss,the odd values will hit, total 150 misses
//B[j][0]：
//    j=0        B[0][0]、B[1][0]       2
//    j=1        B[1][0]、B[2][0]       1
//      ...
//    total  2+99=101 misses
```

Prefetch

```cpp
for (j=0; j<100; j=j+1){
		Prefetch(b[j+7][0]);		
		prefetch(a[0][j+7]);
		a[0][j]=b[j][0]*b [j+1][0];}; 
// a[0][1] a[0][2] a[0][4] a[0][6]:4 misses
// b:2+5= 7 misses
for (i=1; i<3; i=i+1)
for (j=0; j<100; j=j+1){
		prefetch(a[i][j+7]);
		a[i][j]=b[j][0]*b [j+1][0];};
//4 misses for a[1][j]
//4 misses for a[2][j]
//Total:  19 misses
//save 232 cache misses at the price of 400 prefetch instructions.
