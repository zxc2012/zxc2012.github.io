# 9 Complex Pipelining
## Basics
### Advanced Data Hazard

Out-of-order write hazards due to variable latencies of different functional units(FDIV,FMUL takes more than one cycle)

### In-order and Out-of-order

RAW(red) WAR(purple) WAW(green)

regrardless of WAR, look for what can be fetched next(dependency), if empty finish execute waiting instruction

### Table for Correct Issue

## In-order

Assuming: Suppose the instruction is not issued	by the Issue stage if a RAW	hazard exists or the required FU is busy,and that operands are registered by functional unit on issue

- NO WAR: Earlier instructions read	their operands at issue
    - no need to keep src1 and src2
- still WAW	hazard: e.g. Out-of-order completion
    - WP[reg#],a bit-vector to record the registers for which writes are pending(cleared after WB stage)
    - Busy[FU#],a bit-vector to	indicate FU’s availability(FU=	Int,Add,Mult,Div)

Lookup:

- FU available?	*Busy[FU#]*
- RAW? *WP[src1] or WP[src2]*
- WAW? *WP[dest]*		

Example

Diagnol means pipeline

## Out-of-order

Decode adds	next instruction to	buffer	if	there is space and the instruction does not	cause a	WAR	or WAW hazard.	

Note: WAR possible again because issue is out-of-order(WAR not possible with in-order issue and registering of input operands at functional unit)	

Example

Number of Registers limit the number of instructions in	the	pipeline.

Solution: Renaming 5 f4->f4'(no WAW hazard)

### Renaming Table

Decode does register renaming and adds instructions to the	 issue-stage instruction reorder buffer(ROB)

tag deallocated-> broadcast and some src p1(present) set to 1

![20220520111838](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220520111838.png)

### Reorder Buffer

ROB	managed	circularly
- exec bit is set when instruction begins execution
- When an instruction completes, its use bit is marked free(ptr2 incremented and tag deallocated)

    *deallocated also known as commited*

Instruction is candidate for execution when
- use bit is set
- p1 and p2 are set 
- has not started execution(exec 0)

### Physical Register Management

Decoding and Despatching all the instructions into ROB first, then go back and execute
- Free List: Physical Register currently available
- Rd: Architecture Register
- LPRd: Last Physical Register

## Load-Store Issue

- Store commits	when oldest	instruction	and	
both address and data available:		
    - clear speculative	bit	and	eventually move data to cache
- On store abort:clear valid bit

## Branch Prediction
### Static branch prediction

Flush: penalty 2

![20260429141321](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20260429141321.png)

Fast branch: have branch instr’s that can resolve in D, not X, penalty 1
- On taken branch, must flush one instr and “bypass” from thedecode 
stage
- Must now have additional comparison instr’s (e.g., cmplt, slt) to 
support complex tests
### Dynamic branch prediction
- Temporal correlation: The way a branch resolves may	be a good predictor of the	way	it	will resolve at	the next execution
- Spatial correlation: Several branches may resolve in a	highly correlated manner(a preferred path of execution)

#### Temporal Correlation

One bit Branch history table (BHT)

last fail -> invert the bit

![20220529165614](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zxc2012/image/main/20220529165614.png)

Two bits Branch predictor

Change the prediction after two	consecutive	mis-predictions

#### Spatial Correlation

Branch history register (BHR): A History register, records the direction of the last N branches	executed by	the	processor

1-bit BHT+3-bit BHR
